#Codebook
Coursera assignment, 2014

##Overview 

Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.  The full data set and further descriptions is available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This Codebook describes a shortened data set with a subset of extracted columns from the full data set. The extracted columns shows only the values for the standard deviation and mean values inside the full data set.

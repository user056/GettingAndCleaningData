# Getting and cleaning data 
Course assignment, Coursera 2014 


##Running the provided R script
The Samsung data should be available unziped in the working directory.

The script `run_analysis.R` uses the following hard coded local filesystem paths, which need to be adjusted based on the used environment.

* setwd("C:/Users/marc/Documents/coursera-RR/course03")
*  data_input_folder <- file.path(getwd(), "UCI HAR Dataset")

Afterwards as usual it is needed to source the R file and call it with 'course3()'
